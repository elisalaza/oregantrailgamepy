# oregantrailgamepy
An updated version of annaspencer's Oregon Trail. This is the first time I've created a program using python but i was able to fall back on my knowledge java to edit and change somethings in annaspencers version. I decided to allow the user to pick a chacter each one with different pros and cons. I also changed the begining 
omniscient narrator to a general clerk manager. I created abilities and dialouge for each character except for the farmer. I think if i decide to work on the this project more i could introduce a hunting aspect of the game by having the user choose a random number between 1 and 10 to get a hit or a miss. The farmer would be able to have an advantage in the hunting gameplay. I also created a loop that asks the user if they would like to play again everytime they die or win. I think it would also be intresting to add a counter to the game to add for more varied dialouge options and different encounters during different parts of the game. Like i said this was my first time programming with python so i had to guess on a lot of stuff. I didn't know what the time_space varible was used for but i seemed to be able to make a functioning progam without it. It was alot of fun and it would be intresting to see how in depth this game could get.
